### `:root`
`:root` represents the `<html>` element and is identical to the selector `html`, except that its 
[specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) is higher.

### CSS Variables
Custom properties (sometimes referred to as CSS variables or cascading variables) are entities defined by CSS authors that 
contain specific values to be reused throughout a document. 
They are set using custom property notation (e.g., `--main-color: black;`) and are accessed using the `var()` function (e.g., `color: var(--main-color);`).
