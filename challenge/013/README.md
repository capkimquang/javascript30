### `debounce()` function
The [`debounce()`](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-use-the-debounce-function-in-javascript) 
function forces a function to wait a certain amount of time before running again. The function is built to limit the number of times a function is called.

### `scrollY`
The read-only [`scrollY`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scrollY) 
property of the Window interface returns the number of pixels that the document is currently scrolled vertically compared to the top. This value is subpixel precise in modern browsers, meaning that it isn't necessarily a whole number. 
You can get the number of pixels the document is scrolled horizontally from the scrollX property.

### `innerHeight`
The read-only [`innerHeight`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerHeight) 
property of the Window interface returns the interior height of the window in pixels, including the height of the horizontal scroll bar, if present.

### `offsetTop`
The [`HTMLElement.offsetTop`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetTop) 
read-only property returns the distance of the current element relative to the top of the 
[`offsetParent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLelement/offsetParent) node.
